1. Name at least two optimizations employed in either the MinGen or Genetic Algorithm implementation used to boost performance.
2. Why is the exhaustive MinGen Algorithm unable to compute an anonymized table for `table2.csv` in the example folder?
3. How is the Genetic Algorithm implementation able to deliver superior performance to MinGen on larger tables, and what is the trade-off incurred by this approach?
